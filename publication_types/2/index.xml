      <description>The strong relationship between motor and cognitive development suggests that the limited motor experience of children with physical disabilities can impact their cognitive and perceptual development. The assessment of their cognitive skills is also compromised due to limited verbal communication and motor gestures. Robots have been used to give children with disabilities an opportunity to independently manipulate objects and to reveal their cognitive skills when they use the robots. Little is known about the neural correlates that subtend robotic augmentative manipulation and the ways in which using a robot to manipulate objects may change the task&amp;rsquo;s cognitive and perceptual demands.</description>
